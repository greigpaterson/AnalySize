Included in this release of AnalySize and a number of synthetic example data sets.

1) Test_Data.dat and Test_Data.xlsx
A set of synthetic data consisting of 50 specimens "measured" with 100 grain size bins.
Test_Data.dat includes the data in a tab delimited text file.
Test_Data.xlxs includes the data in an Excel spreadsheet. The "Format1" sheet presents the data where rows are specimens and columns are grain size bins. The "Format2" sheet presents the data where rows are grain size bins and columns are specimens.

2) Example_Data_1.xlsx
Three sets of synthetic data consisting of 200 specimens "measured" with 100 grain size bins.
These data were used to construct Figure 1 in Paterson & Heslop (2015)..
Data are in Excel Format 1, where rows are specimens and columns are grain size bins.
Sheet "k=2" is the 2 end member case, sheet "k=3" is the 3 end member case, and sheet "k=4" is the 4 end member case.

3) Example_Data_2.xlsx
A set of synthetic data consisting of 100 specimens "measured" with 100 grain size bins.
These data were used to construct Figure 2 in Paterson & Heslop (2015)..
Data are in Excel Format 1, where rows are specimens and columns are grain size bins.
Sheet "Data" contains the AnalySize readable data, sheet "True_Data" contains the true end members and abundances.
