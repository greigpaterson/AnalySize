## Introduction
AnalySize is a MATLAB based software tool to aid Earth scientists make sense of their grain size data. AnalySize incorporates a range of powerful unmixing techniques alongside several routine methods for quantifying grain size data. AnalySize presents these tool in a clear, easy to use graphical interface that is compatible with a wide range of software platforms. AnalySize is a mathematical tool to help understand data set. Like all such tools and analyses, these mathematical procedures require physical ground-truthing with data and information outside of AnalySize. Users should strive to use physical constraint to find a balance between physical plausibility and numerical optimization.

If users encounter bugs or problems using AnalySize, or have any suggestions for improving the software, we would really like to hear from as all input is welcome. If you use AnalySize in your work, please make it clear what version was used and the what method of unmixing was used. We would also be grateful if you cited the publication that introduced AnalySize: Paterson, G. A., and D. Heslop (2015), New methods for unmixing sediment grain size data, _Geochem. Geophys. Geosyst._, 16, 4494â€“4506, doi:[10.1002/2015GC006070](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015GC006070).

More information on the unmixing algorithms used in AnalySize can be found in Paterson & Heslop (2015). Details on how to use AnalySize are provided in the instruction manual packaged with AnalySize.

The latest version of the software the GitHub front page (https://github.com/greigpaterson/AnalySize). Different versions can be gotten from the "releases" tab (https://github.com/greigpaterson/AnalySize/releases).
